# Q_Learning
Graphical representation of Q Learning algorithm in Python.


The point of this application is to make a visual representation of Q_Learning algorithm in Python.

Here is how it works:
An application tries to find the quickest path from left upper corner to right bottom corner by randomly jumping from one square to another. A user can eliminate few squares from being taken into consideration by clicking on them. Thus, they won't be accessible by the algorithm, and the path will be blocked by them. Here is how it works:

1. Initializing application

2. Choose blocking squares
