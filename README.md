# Q_Learning
Graphical representation of Q Learning algorithm in Python.


The point of this application is to make a visual representation of Q_Learning algorithm in Python.

Here is how it works:
An application tries to find the quickest path from left upper corner to right bottom corner by randomly jumping from one square to another. A user can eliminate few squares from being taken into consideration by clicking on them. Thus, they won't be accessible by the algorithm, and the path will be blocked by them.
